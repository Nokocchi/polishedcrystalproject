Events are set to 0 by default. If you define them in initialize_events.asm, they are initialized as 1.
If an event is connected to an object, the object is shown if event is 0, and object is hidden if event is 1.
So initializing an event sets it to 1, which hides the object. 
appear sprite => set event to 0
disappear sprite => set event to 1 

You can see which bank different files are in, if you check main.asm
